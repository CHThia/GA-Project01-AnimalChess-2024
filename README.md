## Game Synopsis
Animal Chess (also known as Jungle King) is a Chinese board game that is mostly played among children.  

This strategy game is played between 2-players where they controlled 8 game pieces that represent different animals of various strength.

The players also used a 7 x 9 game-board (consists of 63 squares) with special element like “river”, “traps” and “beast den” to model a jungle-like-terrain. 

In my version of this game, the game-board do not use the special elements- "river" and "traps".
